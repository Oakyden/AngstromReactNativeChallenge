# Angstrom React Native Challenge

This project contains a starter setup for a React Native Project. 
The goal sof this challenge is to create a simple app that displays a list of Premier League teams. 
The list of teams should appear after launching the app and should be fetched from the provided API.

## API Documentation
The domain for the API is `https://www.thesportsdb.com/`.

The API endpoint to fetch the list of Premier League teams is `/api/v1/json/3/search_all_teams.php?l=English%20Premier%20League`.

The API endpoint to fetch the list of players is `/api/v1/json/3/searchplayers.php?t=Arsenal`

## Task
- We would like you to create a simple app that displays a list of Premier League teams. The design of the screen won't be assessed, but each team should display the team's name and crest as a minimum.
- When a team is clicked the app should navigate to a new screen that displays a list of players for that team. The design of the screen won't be assessed, but each player should display the player's name and position as a minimum.
- Where appropriate, please add unit tests to your code.

Good luck!
